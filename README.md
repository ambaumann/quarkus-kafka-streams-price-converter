# Price Converter Kafka Streams Application

Quick notes before I go to bed:

* make namespace
* make kafka cluster
* make usd-prices and eur-prices topics
* Make minor updates to deploy Deployment yaml file for namespace.
* oc apply deploy folder
* Build quarkus app locally using mvn clean install
* Build an image with `oc start-build mybuild --from-dir=.`
